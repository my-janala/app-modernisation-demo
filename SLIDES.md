## Slide 3: Opening Question
**How many of you help organizations migrate legacy apps to Kubernetes?**

*Chat responses welcome*

**What's your biggest challenge with legacy-to-cloud migrations?**
- Unknown application dependencies
- Containerization complexity
- Time-consuming manual assessment
- Migration risk and planning

---

## Slide 4: The Reality Check
**Legacy Applications: Asset or Liability?**

- **70%** of enterprise workloads run on traditional infrastructure
- **$300B+** annual technical debt costs (Fortune 500)
- **18 months** average modernization timeline
- **60%** of projects face unexpected blockers

*Legacy applications represent millions in business logic - the question isn't whether to modernize, it's how to modernize safely.*

---

## Slide 5: The Six Rs of Modernization
**Strategic Approaches to Application Modernization**

1. **Retain** - Keep as-is when it meets requirements
2. **Retire** - Decommission applications with no value
3. **Rehost** - "Lift and Shift" to new infrastructure  
4. **Replatform** - "Lift, Tinker, Shift" with incremental improvements
5. **Refactor** - Re-architect for cloud-native patterns
6. **Repurchase** - "Drop and Shop" for SaaS solutions

*The challenge: How do you choose the right approach for each application?*

---

## Slide 6: Traditional Assessment Challenges
**Manual Analysis Problems**

**Time Consuming**
- Weeks or months per application
- Manual code review bottlenecks
- Inconsistent methodologies

**Error Prone** 
- Human oversight and bias
- Missed dependencies
- Incomplete analysis

**Not Scalable**
- Limited to small portfolios
- Expert knowledge bottleneck
- Inconsistent results

---

## Slide 7: Enter Konveyor

---

## Slide 10: Common Legacy Issues
**What Konveyor Typically Finds**

**File System Dependencies**
```java
FileInputStream stream = new FileInputStream("/opt/config/app.properties");
```
*Problem: Hardcoded paths, ephemeral storage*

**Hardcoded Network Configuration**
```properties
jdbc.url=jdbc:oracle:thin:@192.168.1.100:1521/PROD
```
*Problem: No portability, manual updates required*

**Configuration Management**
- Properties files in application JARs
- Environment-specific builds
- Manual deployment processes

---

## Slide 11: Kubernetes-Native Solutions
**Modern Configuration Management**

**ConfigMaps for Application Settings**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: app-config
data:
  database.url: ${DB_HOST}:${DB_PORT}
  logging.level: INFO
```

**Secrets for Sensitive Data**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: app-secrets
stringData:
  db-password: ${DB_PASSWORD}
```

**Environment Variable Injection**
- Kubernetes-native service discovery
- External configuration management
- Zero-downtime configuration updates

---

## Slide 12: Before vs After
**Transformation Journey**

| **Before (Legacy)** | **After (Cloud-Native)** |
|---------------------|---------------------------|
| Manual server management | Kubernetes orchestration |
| Hardcoded configurations | Environment-based config |
| File-based storage | Persistent volumes/services |
| Manual scaling | Auto-scaling capabilities |
| Monolithic deployments | Containerized microservices |
| Environment-specific builds | Immutable container images |

---

## Slide 13: ROI Calculation
**Quantifying the Value**

**Time Savings Example:**
- Senior architect: 3 weeks manual analysis = **$15,000** labor cost
- Konveyor: 30 minutes automated analysis = **$50** compute cost
- **Scale across 100 applications = $1.4M savings**

**Risk Reduction:**
- 50% fewer migration surprises
- 60-80% faster time-to-cloud
- Predictable modernization timelines

**Resource Efficiency:**
- Architects focus on architecture, not analysis
- Consistent assessment methodology
- Portfolio-wide visibility
