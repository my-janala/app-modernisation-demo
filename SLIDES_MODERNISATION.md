    I --> K[Skills Shortage] 
    I --> L[Risk & Complexity]
```

### The Business Reality
**Companies need to move fast, but legacy systems hold them back**

---

---
---
## Slide 3: Legacy Application Landscape

```ascii
TYPICAL ENTERPRISE (Fortune 500)

APPLICATION PORTFOLIO:
├── 2,000+ Applications
├── 70% Built 10+ Years Ago
├── Multiple Technologies
└── Critical Business Logic

CURRENT CHALLENGES:
├── $2M Annual Maintenance
├── 6-Month Release Cycles
├── Security Vulnerabilities
└── Talent Retention Issues
```

**Sound familiar?**

## Slide 4: Modernisation Business Drivers

### Why Modernise Now?

```mermaid

    root((Business Value))
        (Cost Reduction)
            60% Lower Infrastructure
            40% Faster Development
        (Speed to Market)
            Weekly vs Monthly Releases
            Continuous Deployment
        (Scalability)
            Auto-scaling
            Global Distribution
        (Security)
            Modern Security Practices
            Compliance Ready
```

### Which Path for Your Applications?

## Slide 6: The Assessment Problem

### Traditional Approach: Manual Analysis

```ascii
MANUAL ASSESSMENT APPROACH:
- Team of 5 Architects
- 6 weeks per application
- 200+ page documents
- $50,000+ per assessment

PROBLEMS:
├── Inconsistent Results
├── Human Error Prone
├── Doesn't Scale
└── Misses Hidden Dependencies
```

**There has to be a better way...**

## Slide 8: Real-World Example (Case Study: Before/After)

### Before Modernisation
```ascii
MONOLITHIC ARCHITECTURE:
├── Single Java WAR (50GB)
├── Oracle Database
├── Physical Servers
└── 6-month Release Cycle

BUSINESS IMPACT:
├── $500K/month Infrastructure
├── 2-day Deployment Process
├── Cannot Handle Black Friday
└── 5 Critical Outages/Year
```

### After Modernisation
```ascii
CLOUD-NATIVE ARCHITECTURE:
├── Kubernetes Cluster
├── Microservices (User, Product, Cart, Payment, Orders)
├── Managed Database
├── Monitoring & Security

BUSINESS IMPACT:
├── $150K/month Infrastructure
├── 5-minute Deployment
├── Auto-scale for peak events
└── 0.1 incidents/year
```

### Case Study: E-commerce Platform

#### Before Modernization
```ascii
MONOLITHIC ARCHITECTURE:
├── Single Java WAR (50GB)
├── Oracle Database
├── Physical Servers
└── 6-month Release Cycle

BUSINESS IMPACT:
├── $500K/month Infrastructure
├── 2-day Deployment Process
├── Cannot Handle Black Friday
└── 5 Critical Outages/Year
```

## Slide 9: Transformation Journey

### Step 1: Assessment & Discovery

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[E-commerce App] --> B[Konveyor Analysis]
    B --> C[Assessment Report]
    
    C --> D[PASS: Suitable for Containers]
    C --> E[WARN: Database Dependencies]
    C --> F[INFO: 3rd Party Integrations]
    C --> G[RESULT: Migration Complexity - Medium]
```

**Result: Clear path forward in 2 hours vs 6 weeks**

## Slide 9: Business Impact (Before vs After)

### Transformation Results

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|---------|--------|-------------|
| **Deployment** | 2 days | 5 minutes | **99.8%** faster |
| **Infrastructure** | $500K/month | $150K/month | **70%** reduction |
| **Scalability** | Fixed capacity | Auto-scale | **10x** peak handling |
| **Releases** | 2 per year | 50+ per year | **25x** frequency |
| **Downtime** | 5 incidents/year | 0.1 incidents/year | **98%** reliability |
