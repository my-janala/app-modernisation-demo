## Supported Versions

This repository is a demo project maintained on a best-effort basis. Security fixes are provided for the `main` branch only.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

2. Include:
   - Steps to reproduce or proof of concept (if available).
   - Impact assessment and affected components.
   - Suggested remediation or workaround.
3. Expect an acknowledgement within **5 business days**. We aim to provide an initial assessment or mitigation plan within **10 business days** of confirmation.

Please do not open public GitHub issues for security reports until we mutually agree the issue is ready to disclose.

## Disclosure Process
